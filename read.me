For my final web map I was attempting to make a map showing the change or the Bering glacier over time. I was trying to get three datasets one for 2000, 2010, and 2020. I had them in QGIS and finally got them to show up in geojson.io. I never could get them loaded on my map or on any other map template. I finished off the rest so that I could add the paragraphs and links and change some of the styling. I was also going to put a layer control on the map so you could toggle between each year but without the data I couldnt do that. I am still not sure what was wrong or why my data wouldnt load in my map. I feel like I tried many different ways to download my data and load it into my map but nothing seemed to work.  I was excited about this project because I felt that it was going to be my best finished product. I wouldve enjoyed seeing it completed with the data and the layer control.
